<h1>Layouts</h1>
<p>
In each of the three layouts that Murray discusses in chapter 13 (pies, stacks, and force charts,) there is a common theme regarding how 
the data is represented. The visualization of each data point is dependent on the values of the other data points in the set. In pies, this 
is seen in the size of each slice, in stacks it is the starting point of a section, and in force charts it is the x/y layout of a node in 
relation to the other nodes. With this in mind, the presence of inderdependent data should be a trigger that one of these three layouts 
will be useful. To use them, you run the D3 core algorithim and also use a cooresponding D3 function to set up your visualization. That 
function will also have attributes that dictate how the data should be treated.
